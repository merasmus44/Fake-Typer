# Fake-Typer
This python program will type like a human. Yes, it's pretty useless but I thought it would be a fun project.
It will type as a normal person does, making errors, then deleting and correcting them. It can sometimes make errors within it's errors, but it will always end up typing the correct answer (as long as it's a normal text charater).

Fully customiziable, variable in top of file control things like the error chance and such.

Requires pygame, json
